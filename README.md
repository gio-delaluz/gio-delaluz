### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Giovanni**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdelaluz/), a first-generation CS student and Bioinformatics researcher at Cal Poly SLO. 

I currently conduct research at [**@Cal Poly's Bioinformatics Research Group (BiRG)**](https://lab.birg.dev/). Previously, I researched at [**@UCR**](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) and [**@USC**](https://keck.usc.edu/biostatistics/).

My work focuses on the intersection of software engineering, data science, and molecular biology. To solve complex biological problems, I develop machine learning representations and engineer automation pipelines to analyze large-scale biological datasets. My goal is to accelerate scientific discovery, support the development of novel treatments, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
